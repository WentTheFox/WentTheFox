My name is David and Iâ€™m generally shy and introverted. I work as a professional web developer and regularly play PC games in my free time, for example Beat Saber. I consider myself to be part of the broader furry community. I occasionally participate in related events to relax, or to hang out with friends. My personal favorite animal species are foxes, but I like canines in general, besides other four-legged creatures.
