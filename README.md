# DJDavid98

My name is David and Iâ€™m generally shy and introverted. I work as a professional web developer and regularly play PC games in my free time, for example Beat Saber. I consider myself to be part of the broader furry community. I occasionally participate in related events to relax, or to hang out with friends. My personal favorite animal species are foxes, but I like canines in general, besides other four-legged creatures.

## Distraction

Why look at my code when my fursona is so much cuter?

They are wearing a blue collar attached to a leash, the end of which they are holding in their left hand, and rainbow-colored arm and leg warmers, while sitting on a ledge. They're looking at you with their mouth slighly open.](https://furrycdn.org/img/2023/4/12/236442/large.png)
